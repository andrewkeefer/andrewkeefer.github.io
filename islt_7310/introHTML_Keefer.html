     Hello everyone! My name is Andrew Keefer. I currently live in Columbia, but I am from Texas. One day I want to move back to California when I get older, that is where my family was originally from before we moved to Texas when I was young. This year will be my fifth year of college. I have gone to four different colleges in my five years, so I do not really have a favorite team except for Missouri now. I am super happy to be in this class. Learning about computers seems cool, but I do not have much experience since taking some Computer Science courses earlier in my undergrad, but I am excited to learn. I expect to refresh things I have already learned to absorb a lot of new information to take with me on my job hunt to be a teacher at a high school. I am currently a baseball player at Mizzou right now, trying to stay away from COVID so we can have a season this year, My passions in life are working out, playing baseball and of course like everyone elseâ€¦ washing my hands thoroughly throughout the entire day with warm water and soap.
