Hello everyone, my name is Andrew Keefer. This year will be my fifth year of college. I have gone to four different colleges in my five years, so I do not really have a favorite team except for Missouri now. I am a former horned frog and maverick and now I am a <strong>Tiger</strong>!!!<br><br>I am a student athlete who plays baseball here at Missouri. I would like to be a Campus Technology specialist in a school district and baseball coach or just a general high school teacher who coaches baseball and teachers a higher-level math class.
</p>
<h3>Crendetials</h3>
I have student taught for a combined year TCU ages PreK-to 8th grade. Up until 9th grade I scored a perfect score on the State math exam every year, so math has always been a passion of mine. I am currently in the School of Information Science and Learning Technologies. I have about a year left but until then I am eager to absorb all the information I can.
<h5>Quote</h5>
<p>
Famous quote from a NHL Hall of Famer and is considered the greatest hockey player of all time with my favorite quote of all time.
</p><blockquote>“You <em>miss</em> 100% shots you <em>don't</em> take”. - Wayne Gretzky</blockquote><p>This speaks to many levels, such as you miss all the chances in life you don't take or the risks in life you don't take. This quote really hits home.
